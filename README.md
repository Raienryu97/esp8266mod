####How To Program

Programming can be done in two simple ways, either in Lua or through Arduino IDE, whichever you are comfortable with.

In case you want to use Lua, then this [LuaLoader](http://benlo.com/esp8266/index.html#LuaLoader) can be a good IDE to start with.

Else, you can use Arduino IDE by following the steps [here](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager)

This repository is aimed at documenting my various codes for this module.
